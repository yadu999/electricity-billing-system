The Electricity Billing System is a desktop-based application developed to automate and streamline the monthly billing process for electricity consumption in a utility office. Traditional manual billing systems often involve repetitive paperwork, human calculation errors, and delays in bill generation. This project aims to address these challenges by computerizing the entire billing workflow through a robust and user-friendly software solution.

The system provides two major user roles — Administrator and Customer — each with specific access privileges. The Administrator has the ability to register new customers, manage customer information, input meter details, and generate monthly bills based on recorded unit consumption. The Customer, on the other hand, can log in securely to view personal information, check billing details, download or print bill receipts, and make or record payments. This dual-interface approach ensures both operational control and customer transparency.

Technically, the system is developed using the Java programming language, with Java Swing employed for creating the graphical user interface (GUI). The backend logic is implemented in Java using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect to a MySQL database, which stores all relevant data such as customer records, meter readings, billing details, and payment transactions. This combination of technologies provides a stable, scalable, and platform-independent solution.

The backend database ensures data persistence, allowing records to be easily accessed, updated, or audited when required. Each transaction, such as bill generation or payment confirmation, is securely recorded with timestamped entries, improving reliability and accountability. Additionally, the use of relational tables and structured query management enables efficient data retrieval and reporting, supporting administrative analysis and customer queries.

The Electricity Billing System automates bill calculations by applying relevant rates, taxes, penalties, and fixed charges, minimizing human error and ensuring consistency in every billing cycle. It also includes features for generating and printing bill receipts, viewing previous transactions, and managing payment statuses. These functionalities collectively make the application both efficient and time-saving, reducing manual workload and improving overall productivity in utility offices.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates how a well-designed desktop application can effectively modernize traditional billing operations. By integrating a reliable database with an interactive graphical interface, the system achieves speed, accuracy, and transparency in electricity billing. It serves as a scalable foundation that can be further extended with online payment modules or smart meter integration in the future, making it a significant step toward digital automation in energy management.
